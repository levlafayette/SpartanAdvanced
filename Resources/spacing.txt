Spacing in shell scripts is important!

$ UPDATE_STATUS=0
$ if [[ ${UPDATE_STATUS}=1 ]]; then echo Why does this work; fi

What's wrong with spaces in filenames?

$ touch "This is a long file name"
$ for item in $(ls ./*); do echo ${item}; done

Command line arguments are separated by whitespace, unless the arguments are quoted. When passing arguments to data that is separated by spaces it 
will treat the data as separate fields.

One way around this is to change the Internal Field Separator in the shell script. For example, before loop construct, setting a newline as the 
delimiter instead.

$ mkdir test; cd test
$ touch "This is a long file name"
$ cat ifs.sh
#!/bin/bash
IFS=$'\n'
for item in $(ls ./*)
	do echo ${item}
done
unset IFS
exit 0
